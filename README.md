Exploratory Data Analysis TMDB Movies


This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDs), including release data, popularity, and revenue. I would like to find an interesting insight from this dataset. I found out that the number of movies produced are increasing exponentially from 1970s as a tipping point because Star Wars (1977) generated a surprisingly high revenue with an average budget at that time.
